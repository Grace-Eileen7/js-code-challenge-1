# Week 1 JavaScript Code Challenge

## 📋 Description

This repository contains beginner-friendly JavaScript solutions for three basic problem-solving challenges. The challenges are designed to reinforce concepts like user input, calculations, conditional logic, and working with functions in JavaScript. Each solution is a standalone JavaScript file that can be run in the browser console.

### Challenges Included:
1. **Chai Bora Ingredient Calculator** – Calculates the ingredients needed to make a specific number of cups of Kenyan chai.
2. **Boda Boda Fare Estimator** – Estimates the total fare for a boda boda ride based on distance.
3. **Mobile Money Fee Estimator** – Calculates/estimates the transaction fee and total amount debited when sending money.

Each challenge is organized in its own folder with a `.js` file containing the solution.

## 🛠️ Project Setup

To run any of the JavaScript files:
1. Open the folder for the challenge you're interested in (e.g., `chaiCalculator/chai.js`).
2. Open the `.js` file using your preferred code editor or the browser console.
3. The program will prompt you for input and display results in the console.
4. Repeat the same for `fare.js` and `fee.js`.

> Optionally, you can link the JavaScript file to a simple HTML page and run it in a browser.
